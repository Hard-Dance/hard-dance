𝗪𝗲 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗨𝗡𝗜𝗧𝗘𝗗 𝗧𝗛𝗥𝗢𝗨𝗚𝗛 𝗠𝗔𝗗𝗡𝗘𝗦𝗦! 🧬💙  
On April 11, 12 & 13, 2025, we invite you and your friends to join us for an unforgettable, never-ending weekend of mind-bending harder styles madness! 👨🏼‍🎤🤘🏼

Together as one, we will explore the wildest illusions our scene has to offer. From Classics to RAW, Euphoric to Uptempo, and everything in between, only the most dedicated ravers can handle the chaos that marks the official kick off of the festival season.

From Friday to Sunday, we’ll invade your senses with all your favourite artists, mind-blowing premieres, exclusive showcases, epic battles, and much more in our countless indoor and outdoor areas, each a portal into a different part of your maniacal mind. You’ll be submerged in a world of freaks where sanity is just a distant memory. Open your mind, let the madness in, and witness chaos explode all around you. The stranger the better! 🧠💥

2025 marks a historic moment—15 editions of REBiRTH Festival madness. Get ready for the most insane celebration yet, featuring special 15-year anniversary showcases, REBiRTH legends, and shows bigger and crazier than anything we’ve ever done before. This will be the milestone you don’t want to miss! 🤩

The love for this music is what moves us, fuels us and drives us. It’s who we are, that’s what we are proud of and that’s what we’ll continue to be!

Claim your spot during our weekend of insanity on April 11, 12 & 13, 2025!
