Sound Garden 2025: Multigroove's summer oasis in the city. May 31st at Lofi üëÅÔ∏è‚Äç

Before we take over IJmuiden beach for Multigroove Festival, our tribe comes together for something special: Sound Garden. Where industrial darkness meets summer light at the edge of Amsterdam. Two worlds collide: an outdoor rave in the Courtyard and proper warehouse vibes in the Club. Techno, (early) hardstyle and hardcore flowing through both spaces. Plus food, drinks, and plenty of space to catch your breath. Lofi echoes the spirit of De Wielingen, our first home. Back when Amsterdam was still untamed, when every warehouse held possibility. The city changed. We didn't.

Multigroove: Sound Garden  
Saturday, May 31st  
14:00 - 23:00  
Lofi, Amsterdam
