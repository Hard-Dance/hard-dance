THE VAULT AWAITS YOU

UNLEASH THE SONIC ONSLAUGHT!  
Brace yourself for an earth-shattering night where the rawest energy collides with unstoppable force! BASS VAULT cracks open the gates of Hardstyle supremacy, delivering a lineup forged in pure sonic destruction.

\----The Purge----  
Manuel Moscardo, aka The Purge, is a DJ/Producer from Monza, Italy, now based in Utrecht, Netherlands. A rising force in Hardstyle, he has performed at top events like Defqon.1, Decibel, Intents Festival, Qapital, and more. Joining Spoontech Records in 2017, he quickly made an impact with his debut EP Beyond Imagination and an impressive 13 releases that year. In 2018, he dropped the explosive Evolution with a killer video, followed by What’s That Sound , one of his most acclaimed tracks. The Purge will be joining us directly after his US debut at ULTRA.

\---Noize Suppressor---  
A pioneering force in Hardcore, Noize Suppressor has dominated the scene since the ‘90s with his powerful sound and electrifying performances. With five groundbreaking albums, he has shaped the genre’s past, present, and future. Known for his raw, high-energy stage presence, his Sonar tour marked a historic moment in Hardcore. Infusing his signature ‘Italian touch’ into both music and performance, Noize Suppressor delivers an unmatched experience that keeps crowds begging for more. A true innovator in the industry, he continues to push boundaries, solidifying his status as one of Hardcore’s most respected and influential figures. He also performs under the alias Bike.

Steel your soul and brace your bones.

The air? Thick with distortion. The ground? Trembling beneath relentless kicks. Time? Irrelevant when the BPM takes control.
