The underground breaks free. After decades of transforming dark warehouses into dance floors, we're unleashing our spirit under the open sky. IJmuiden aan Zee becomes our new sanctuary on September 13th, 2025. The biggest gathering in Multigroove history, where three decades of underground culture explode into the daylight.

Four stages, each telling a chapter of our story:

\- Multigroove: The roots of Rave culture  
\- Hellbound: Hardcore, pure and uncut  
\- De Samenzwering: Hard Techno, the sound of a new generation  
\- Plus a fourth stage we'll reveal soon. Trust us: you're not ready for this one.

This is where pioneers meet the legends of tomorrow. Where every beat echoes our history, and every kickdrum shapes our future. From squatted buildings to beachfront revelry, we've come far, but never lost our soul.

Since '91, we've been pushing boundaries. Now we're taking it beyond imagination.  
This is your calling. This is our legacy.  
Will you be part of history? Tickets are on sale now!
