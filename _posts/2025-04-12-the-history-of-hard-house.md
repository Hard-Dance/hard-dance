HELLFIRE PRESENTS:  
THE HISTORY OF HARD HOUSE  
FEATURING: THE TIDY BOYS & FERGIE (EXCLUSIVE TONY DE VIT SET)  
SATURDAY 12TH APRIL 2025  
DISTRICT, CARDIFF  
10PM-4AM  
STRICTLY OVER 18’S

We’ll be running a series of club shows for 2025 and on Saturday 12th April we’ll be taking over District in Cardiff with a night showcasing The History of Hard House. Featuring 2 of the pioneers of the genre, legendary artists The Tidy Boys and Fergie. Fergie will be playing an exclusive Tony de Vit set on the night so you know this will be a night not to be missed.

It was back in 1995 when Andy Pickles and Amadeus Mozart (aka The Tidy Boys) set up Tidy, which went on to be the biggest hard house label and one of the World’s biggest clubbing brands. The creativity, passion and fun that the boys have delivered both in the studio, in albums, on Tidy TV channels and in live sets has been an inspiration to many. They have never taken themselves seriously and always had their tongue firmly planted in their cheeks but The Tidy Boys have proved that they are true entertainers and love what they do. In 2025 Tidy celebrates 30 years, an achievement rarely seen by many labels and brands, a tour and special events are being planned, and The Tidy Boys will always be at the front of the celebrations.

Fergie is a renowned Irish DJ and producer. He was entertaining people since he could barely walk and took up DJing not long after that. He's best known for his heavy-hitting, maximal style of party techno as well as being one of the most loveable and charismatic DJs in the business. He's been resident at mega-club brands from Godskitchen to Trade, and from Space Ibiza to Hakkasan Las Vegas. When he was 15, he had a chance meeting with one of the biggest DJs in the UK, Tony De Vit. They sparked a friendship and Tony took Fergie under his wing to teach him about the world of dance music. It set Fergie on a path to stardom. He’ll be playing an exclusive Tony de Vit set at this event and it promises to be something special.
