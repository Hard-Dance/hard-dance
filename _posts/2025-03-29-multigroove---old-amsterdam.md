Amsterdam is turning 750. Our beloved city of rebels, pirates, and free spirits deserves nothing less than a proper Multigroove celebration.

On March 29th, we're returning to the Westerunie and this time we're stepping up our game. Three areas dedicated to the city that gave birth to our culture. From squatted warehouses to underground tunnels, this one's for our forever home.

This is our tribute to 750 years of Amsterdam attitude. To every raver who found their tribe in our city's dark corners. To every DJ who started in a basement and conquered the world. To every dancer who turned our industrial wastelands into temples of sound.

Three areas. One mission. Forever Amsterdam. Forever Multigroove.

Lineup: Arjuna, Baba, Bass-D, Crazy Shaun, Dano, Fausto, JP, Noxa, Olive Anguz, Pavo, Pila, Pim Bosman, Requez, Tellurian
